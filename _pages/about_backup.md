Security is a fundamental part of our daily lives, and its importance will only continue to grow as technology advances.  
My work focuses on **understanding, anticipating, and mitigating** the ever-evolving threats that challenge digital trust.

I’m **Ángel**, a **Cybersecurity professional** with over six years of progressive experience as a **Database Administrator**, **Cybersecurity Analyst**, and currently as a **Cybersecurity Lead**.

I began my career managing **critical database environments** in *SQL Server* and *Oracle* (Exadata and x86).  
Those early years taught me to appreciate the importance of **reliability, precision, and resilience** in production systems — and to stay calm under pressure during **War Room** incidents directly affecting business operations.

After leading a **database encryption and data masking project**, I transitioned into the **Cybersecurity** team, where I discovered my true passion: protecting systems through the lens of **cryptography**.  
Over time, I took on the responsibility of **leading the Cryptography and Vulnerability Management areas**, coordinating both technical and strategic initiatives.

In this role, I led **HOST–ATM cryptographic operations** using **Hardware Security Modules (HSM)** to ensure secure key exchanges and compliance with strict **banking regulations**.  
I also oversaw the **PKI infrastructure** and managed the **end-to-end vulnerability lifecycle**, from detection and prioritization to mitigation across complex enterprise environments.

These years have taught me that **cybersecurity goes beyond the exploit**.  
It’s not only about identifying attack vectors — it’s about **understanding their roots**, anticipating their evolution, and building the resilience to respond effectively and align security with business needs.
